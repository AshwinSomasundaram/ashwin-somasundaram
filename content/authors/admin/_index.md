Hey there! I'm Ashwin, a rising sophomore at UT Dallas majoring in Computer Science. My main interests include AI/Deep learning and Data Science. I am developing skills to build intelligent systems that can perform complex tasks better than humans. I am a member of the Computing Scholars CS^2 Program and the Collegium V Honors Program.

I am currrently working on a project using convolutional neural nets to find the difference between images of animal species. In my free time, I enjoy competitive programming,learning new concepts in robotics, playing basketball, and getting involved on campus.
